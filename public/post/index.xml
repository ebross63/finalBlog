      <description>Histograms with ggplot2 and ggiraphCreating histograms is another simple data visualization technique that can be extreamly helpful when looking at data sets. To explore histograms, we will use MLB data from R’s Lahman package. We will also use the ggplot2 package to make a histogram.
To begin this project, install all required R packages. Also include ggiraph because we will use it later:
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Cleaning the DataWe would like to look at a histogram for MLB players’ recorded weight.</description>

      <description>Scatter Plots with ggplot2 and ggiraphSimple data visualization can provide insight that is easy to view and understand. To explore scatter plots, we will use MLB data from R’s Lahman package. We will also use the ggiraph package to make an interactive scatter plot.
To begin this project, install all required R packages:
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Creating the datasetIn this example we will look at career homeruns vs.</description>
